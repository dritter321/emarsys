# Local Testing
The SQL queries follow the syntax of Sqlite3.
You can create, populate, and verify SQLite database with the two tables needed with the following command:
<br>`python create_sqlite_marketing_data_db.py`
<br>You can then run the queries on the database using the following commands:
<br>`python execute_task_01.py`
<br>`python execute_task_02.py`
<br>`python execute_task_03.py`
